### Features
---
#### Hooks
- User-specific interaction:
 - Follows owner-selected users and occasionally showers them with praise
- General interaction:
 - Listens for 'hello' and 'bye' and responds accordingly
 - Defends his honor against anyone who is a 'dum bitch'

#### Owner-only commands
Can only be performed by the user designated as `:owner_id` in config.yml, which is set in Steven's initialization
- User management:  
 - `!adduser [user_id]` adds a user to whitelisted users list
 - `!addaction [user_id] affirm` configures already tracked user to receieve occasional affirmation
 - `!savedata` dumps all user data into `user_data.yml`
